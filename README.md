# DecronymLive
Userscript which shows meanings of acronyms on Reddit (/r/SpaceX)

Big thanks to [@Two9A](https://github.com/Two9A), his [Decronym bot](https://gist.github.com/Two9A/1d976f9b7441694162c8) was an inspiration and its [data](http://decronym.xyz/) is directly used by DecronymLive.

Installation:
* requirement: [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) (I didn't test other userscript addons)
* go [here](https://github.com/oskarkk/DecronymLive/raw/master/main.user.js) and Tampermonkey should automatically open a window to install the script

To do:
 * optimize
 * add more subreddits
